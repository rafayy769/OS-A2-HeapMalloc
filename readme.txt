Welcome to the source code for PA2! 

The following files are included:

-- ackermann.h / ackermann.c : These files contain all the code ready to test your allocator. Call the function "ackermann_main()" from your main program.

-- my_allocator.h / my_allocator.c : These files contain the implementation file with placeholders for the implementations of the functions defined in the header file. This code is operational as-is, but you need to replace the implementation with yours!

-- memtest.c : This file calls the "ackermann_main()" function to test your allocator. You will need to add initialization and clean-up of the allocator on exit as specified in the manual.

-- makefile : This file tells 'make' how to compile everything together.
